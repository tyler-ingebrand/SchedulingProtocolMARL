# Decentralized Conflict Resolution for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Through Shared Scheduling Protocols
### By Tyler Ingebrand*, Sophia Smith*, and Ufuk Topcu.

This is the official repo for "Decentralized Conflict Resolution for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Through Shared Scheduling Protocols" submitted to CDC. Experimental results are included in gridgame/results, and can be reproduced using run_experiments.py. 

gridgame is a gridworld with a variable number of agents acting the hallway environment. It follows the [Petting Zoo interface](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/PettingZoo). MARL is handled by a seperate repo, [added as a submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules), called [ModularRL](https://github.com/tyler-ingebrand/ModularRL). ModularRL allows for the easy creation of MARL learners via a modular interface.
